    <p><h3><center>How the game works?</center></h3></p>
        <p><center>So basically how it works is a country is picked at random (Ex. Canada) by the computer
        and what happens is that the user must think of a country that starts with the last letter of that
        country. So for example if Canada was selected then the user chooses Afghanistan as 'a' is the last
        letter of 'Canada'. Then the user would have to think of another country but, this time
        the user has to think of a country that starts with 'n' as that is the last letter in Afghanistan.
        One of the rules of Atlas is that a user must not repeat a country that has already been inputted.
        if they do then the game end and a score is tallied.</center></p>
