How Atlas Works:

        So basically how it works is a country is picked at random (Ex. Canada) by the computer
        and what happens is that the user must think of a country that starts with the last letter of that
        country. So for example if Canada was selected then the user chooses Afghanistan as 'a' is the last
        letter of 'Canada'. Then the user would have to think of another country but, this time
        the user has to think of a country that starts with 'n' as that is the last letter in Afghanistan.
        One of the rules of Atlas is that a user must not repeat a country that has already been inputted.
        if they do then the game end and a score is tallied. If the user doesn't enter the proper name they
        will be given 3 attempts to enter the correct answer. 

        Eventually the goal is to migrate this entire application over to AWS and use it's web services to 
        achieve the same product while following principles such as availability, security. The goal is to
        use RDS for the MySQL database, S3 for the static portion of the website. Also, use EC2 and Apache
        web servers with cloudfront distribution and Route 53 DNS lookups to run the application more
        effectively.
